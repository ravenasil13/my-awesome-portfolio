                 My name is
                    Raven Guerrero and this is my "About Me" page. Thanks for visiting! You're probably wondering who I
                    am... well allow me to introduce myself.
                    Aside from now knowing my name I should also have you know that I am a San Antonio native
                    who loves her family, her friends, her life and especially her semi-new bright orange Croc slides.
                    I'm a pretty normal person. I Google almost anything and everything and re-watch "The
                    Office" an unhealthy amount of times just like anyone else. I also have a full-time job
                    right now as a medical scribe at an opthalmology office, but when I'm not there I'm
                    either doing something normal like laundry or <i>freaaaaking</i> out about this coding bootcamp
                    program that I'm currently in.
                    Eating is one of my most favorite activities to do. Food, to me, is such a special thing and
                    I love how it can bring people from all different cultures and backgrounds together. Some of my
                    other interests include:
                    spending time with loved ones, enjoying adult beverages, getting outside and being active!, and
                    daydreaming about the life I want.
                    If that sounds like something you're interested in hearing more about or if you have similar
                    interests, feel free to reach out to me!
                    My contact info is located just about this paragraph.
                    Have a good day. :)
